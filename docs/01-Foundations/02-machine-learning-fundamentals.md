# Chapter 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals

## 2.1 Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML models identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data.

### 2.1.1 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning each data point has a known output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs.

## 2.2 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the model tries to find inherent structures or patterns within the data on its own.

### 2.2.1 Clustering Techniques

Clustering is a common unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. Examples include K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
