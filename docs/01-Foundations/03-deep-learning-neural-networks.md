# Chapter 3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## 3.1 What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized branch of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data.

### 3.1.1 Neural Network Architecture

A typical neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer contains nodes (neurons) that process and pass information.

## 3.2 Types of Neural Networks

Different neural network architectures are designed for specific types of tasks, leveraging their unique structures to handle various data formats and problem domains.

### 3.2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are particularly effective for image processing tasks, using convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.
