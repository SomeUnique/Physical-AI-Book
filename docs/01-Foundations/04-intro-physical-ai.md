# Chapter 4: Introduction to Physical AI

## 4.1 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that interact with the real world through sensing, actuation, and decision-making. It combines AI algorithms with robotic and embedded systems.

### 4.1.1 Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence explores how an agent's physical body and its interaction with the environment influence its cognitive capabilities and learning processes.

## 4.2 Key Components of Physical AI

Physical AI systems typically comprise several core components that enable them to perceive, process, and act within their physical surroundings.

### 4.2.1 Sensors and Actuators

Sensors gather data from the environment (e.g., cameras, lidar), while actuators allow the system to perform physical actions (e.g., motors, grippers).
