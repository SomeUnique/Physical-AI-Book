# Chapter 5: Sensor Systems for Physical AI

## 5.1 Overview of Sensor Technologies

Sensor systems are crucial for physical AI, enabling machines to perceive their environment. Various sensor technologies exist, each suited for different types of data collection.

### 5.1.1 Vision-Based Sensors

Cameras (monocular, stereo, depth) are widely used for visual perception, providing rich information about objects, scenes, and movements in the environment.

## 5.2 Lidar and Radar Systems

Lidar and Radar offer complementary sensing capabilities to vision, particularly useful for distance measurement, mapping, and obstacle detection.

### 5.2.1 Principles of Lidar

Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) uses pulsed laser light to measure ranges to the Earth. These light pulses, combined with other data recorded by the airborne system, generate precise 3D information about the shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics.
