# Chapter 5: NAV2 and Autonomous Navigation

## 5.1 Introduction to NAV2

NAV2 (Navigation2) is the current navigation stack for ROS2, providing a complete framework for enabling autonomous mobile robots to navigate complex environments safely and efficiently.

### 5.1.1 Modular Architecture

NAV2 features a highly modular architecture, allowing users to customize and swap out different components (e.g., planners, controllers, recoveries) to suit specific robotic applications.

#### 5.1.1.1 Behavior Trees

NAV2 utilizes behavior trees for high-level control and decision-making, enabling flexible and robust handling of navigation tasks, error recovery, and complex behaviors.

##### 5.1.1.1.1 Custom Behaviors

Users can define and integrate custom behaviors into the behavior tree to extend NAV2's capabilities, addressing unique requirements of their robotic systems.

###### 5.1.1.1.1.1 Behavior Tree Editor

Graphical editors for behavior trees provide an intuitive way to design, visualize, and debug complex navigation logic.

## 5.2 Key Navigation Components

NAV2 comprises several essential components that work in concert to achieve autonomous navigation, including mapping, localization, global planning, and local control.

### 5.2.1 SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

SLAM algorithms enable robots to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously localizing themselves within that map, often using LiDAR or vision sensors.

#### 5.2.1.1 Global Path Planning

Global planners compute optimal paths from a robot's current location to a desired goal within the known map, considering obstacles and environmental constraints.

##### 5.2.1.1.1 Local Path Planning and Control

Local planners and controllers generate short-term trajectories and control commands to guide the robot along the global path, dynamically avoiding unexpected obstacles.

###### 5.2.1.1.1.1 Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance

Advanced local planners incorporate techniques for dynamic obstacle avoidance, allowing robots to react to moving objects in real-time and navigate safely through crowded spaces.
