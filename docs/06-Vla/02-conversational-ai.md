# Chapter 2: Conversational AI for Robotics

## 2.1 Principles of Conversational AI

Conversational AI enables robots to engage in natural, human-like dialogue, understanding context, managing turns, and responding coherently to user queries and commands.

### 2.1.1 Dialogue Management

Dialogue management systems track the state of the conversation, resolve ambiguities, and decide on the robot's next action or response based on user input and internal goals.

#### 2.1.1.1 State Tracking

Dialogue state tracking maintains a representation of the conversation's progress, including user intents, filled slots, and common ground established during the interaction.

##### 2.1.1.1.1 Response Generation

Response generation creates natural language outputs for the robot, which can be template-based, retrieval-based, or fully generative using large language models (LLMs).

## 2.2 Integration with Robotic Systems

Bringing conversational AI to robots involves integrating language understanding and generation with the robot's perception, planning, and action systems.

### 2.2.1 Grounding Language in Perception

For a robot to understand commands like "pick up the red block," the language must be grounded in its perception of the environment, linking linguistic entities to real-world objects.

#### 2.2.1.1 Action Confirmation and Clarification

Robots can use conversational AI to confirm understanding of a command before execution or to ask clarifying questions when faced with ambiguous instructions.
